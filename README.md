# Lane Detection
Lane detection is a fundamental function in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. State-of-the-art methods apply geometric methods and deep learning (DL) models to identify and predict lane segments in a variety of environments such as highway, urban, and rural roads. DL methods have shown higher accuracy in more challenging environments where lanes are either poorly marked or obscured. However, lanes in many irregular road conditions such as vehicle occlusion, excessive shadowing, and lane marking deterioration remain challenging to detect. In this paper, we study the problem of lane segmentation and object placement on lanes. We propose a hybrid DL architecture that combines a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) framework with long-term short-term (LSTM) memory cells and multi-head attention transformers. Our architecture takes advantage of the fact that lane markings are continuous lines and therefore segmentation performance can be improved by using sequences of frames in a continuous driving scene.
